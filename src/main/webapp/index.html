	<h1>HOW PAPER IS MADE</h1>
	<p>*Inspired by the great Dwight Schrute</p>
	<div>
		<h2>The Raw Materials</h2>
		<h3>Trees</h3>
			<p>Half the fiber used in paper is from wood that has been purposely
			harvested to make paper. The other half is generally from recycled
			wood fiber from sawmills, veggies, and other recyclables.</p>
			<p>Trees commonly used are coniferous trees for their longer
			cellulose fibers which creates stronger paper! These are considered
			softwoods in the industry. However, because of innovative paper
			making technology, hardwoods (deciduous trees) are also processable.
		<h3>Other Plant Material</h3>
			<p>Demand is so high that other plants have been used in the paper
			making process such as bamboo and flax. Cigarette paper (or rolling
			paper as the more general term), is made from flax so us cigarette
			smokers don't have to breathe in bleached paper, its a win-win for
			everyone.</p>
		<h3>Other Materials</h3>
			<p>They need to color the paper and throw in chemicals and things too
			like bleaches and dyes and various organic and inorganic fillers.
			This is why we probably shouldn't eat paper</p>

    	<h2>The Manufacturing Process </h2>
    	<h3>Making Pulp</h3>
			<p>In the mechanical process, logs are first tumbled in drums to
				remove the bark. The logs are then sent to grinders, which break
				the wood down into pulp by pressing it between huge revolving
				slabs. The pulp is filtered to remove foreign objects. In the
				chemical process, wood chips from de-barked logs are cooked in a
				chemical solution. This is done in huge vats called digesters. The
				chips are fed into the digester, and then boiled at high pressure
				in a solution of Paper sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. The
				chips dissolve into pulp in the solution. Next the pulp is sent
				through filters. Bleach may be added at this stage, or colorings.
				The pulp is sent to the paper plant.</p>
		<h3>Beating</h3>
			<p>The pulp is next put through a pounding and squeezing process
				called, appropriately enough, beating. Inside a large tub, the pulp
				is subjected to the effect of machine beaters. At this point,
				various filler materials can be added such as chalks, clays, or
				chemicals such as titanium oxide. These additives will influence
				the opacity and other qualities of the final product. Sizings are
				also added at this point. Sizing affects the way the paper will
				react with various inks. Without any sizing at all, a paper will be
				too absorbent for most uses except as a desk blotter. A sizing such
				as starch makes the paper resistant to water-based ink (inks
				actually sit on top of a sheet of paper, rather than sinking in). A
				variety of sizings, generally rosins and gums, is available
				depending on the eventual use of the paper. Paper that will receive
				a printed design, such as gift wrapping, requires a particular
				formula of sizing that will make the paper accept the printing
				properly.</p>
		<h3>Pulp to Paper</h3>
			<p>In order to finally turn the pulp into paper, the pulp is fed or
				pumped into giant, automated machines. One common type is called
				the Fourdrinier machine, which was invented in England in 1807.
				Pulp is fed into the Fourdrinier machine on a moving belt of fine
				mesh screening. The pulp is squeezed through a series of rollers,
				while suction devices below the belt drain off water. If the paper
				is to receive a water-mark, a device called a dandy moves across
				the sheet of pulp and presses a design into it. The paper then
				moves onto the press section of the machine, where it is pressed
				between rollers of wool felt. The paper then passes over a series
				of steam-heated cylinders to remove the remaining water. A large
				machine may have from 40 to 70 drying cylinders.</p>
		<h3>Finishing</h3>
			<p>Finally, the dried paper is wound onto large reels, where it
				will be further processed depending on its ultimate use. Paper is
				smoothed and compacted further by passing through metal rollers
				called calendars. A particular finish, whether soft and dull or
				hard and shiny, can be imparted by the calendars. The paper may be
				further finished by passing through a vat of sizing material. It
				may also receive a coating, which is either brushed on or rolled
				on. Coating adds chemicals or pigments to the paper's surface,
				supplementing the sizings and fillers from earlier in the process.
				Fine clay is often used as a coating. The paper may next be
				supercalendered, that is, run through extremely smooth calendar
				rollers, for a final time. Then the paper is cut to the desired
				size.</p>

		<h2>Environment Concerns</h2>
		<p>The number of trees and other vegetation cut down in order to
			make paper is enormous. Paper companies insist that they plant as
			many new trees as they cut down. Environmentalists contend that the
			new growth trees, so much younger and smaller than what was removed,
			cannot replace the value of older trees. Efforts to recycle used
			paper (especially newspapers) have been effective in at least
			partially mitigating the need for destruction of woodlands, and
			recycled paper is now an important ingredient in many types of paper
			production. </p>
		<p>The chemicals used in paper manufacture, including dyes, inks,
			bleach, and sizing, can also be harmful to the environment when they
			are released into water supplies and nearby land after use. The
			industry has, sometimes with government prompting, cleared up a large
			amount of pollution, and federal requirements now demand
			pollutionfree paper production. The cost of such clean-up efforts is
			passed on to the consumer.</p>
