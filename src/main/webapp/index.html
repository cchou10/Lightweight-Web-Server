	<h1>How Paper is Made</h1>
	<p>*May not be entirely accurate</p>
	<div>
		<h2>The Raw Materials</h2>
		<h3>Trees</h3>
			<p> Half the fiber used in paper is from wood that has been purposely harvested to make paper.
				The other half is generally from recycled wood fiber from sawmills, veggies, and
				other recyclables. </p>
			<p> Trees commonly used are coniferous trees for their longer cellulose fibers which creates
				stronger paper! These are considered softwoods in the industry. However, because of 
				innovative paper making technology, hardwoods (deciduous trees) are also processable. 
		<h3>Other Plant Material</h3>
			<p>Demand is so high that other plants have been used in the paper making process such as 
				bamboo and flax. Cigarette paper (or rolling paper as the more general term), is made 
				from flax so us cigarette smokers don't have to breathe in bleached paper, its a win-win
				for everyone. </p>
