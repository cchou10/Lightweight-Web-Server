	<h3>Trees</h3>
		<p>Half the fiber used in paper is from wood that has been purposely
		harvested to make paper. The other half is generally from recycled
		wood fiber from sawmills, veggies, and other recyclables.</p>
		<p>Trees commonly used are coniferous trees for their longer
		cellulose fibers which creates stronger paper! These are considered
		softwoods in the industry. However, because of innovative paper
		making technology, hardwoods (deciduous trees) are also processable.
	<h3>Other Plant Material</h3>
		<p>Demand is so high that other plants have been used in the paper
		making process such as bamboo and flax. Cigarette paper (or rolling
		paper as the more general term), is made from flax so us cigarette
		smokers don't have to breathe in bleached paper, its a win-win for
		everyone.</p>
	<h3>Other Materials</h3>
		<p>They need to color the paper and throw in chemicals and things too
		like bleaches and dyes and various organic and inorganic fillers.
		This is why we probably shouldn't eat paper</p>
