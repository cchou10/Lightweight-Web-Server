    <h3>Making Pulp</h3>
	<p>In the mechanical process, logs are first tumbled in drums to
		remove the bark. The logs are then sent to grinders, which break
		the wood down into pulp by pressing it between huge revolving
		slabs. The pulp is filtered to remove foreign objects. In the
		chemical process, wood chips from de-barked logs are cooked in a
		chemical solution. This is done in huge vats called digesters. The
		chips are fed into the digester, and then boiled at high pressure
		in a solution of Paper sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. The
		chips dissolve into pulp in the solution. Next the pulp is sent
		through filters. Bleach may be added at this stage, or colorings.
		The pulp is sent to the paper plant.</p>
	<h3>Beating</h3>
	<p>The pulp is next put through a pounding and squeezing process
		called, appropriately enough, beating. Inside a large tub, the pulp
		is subjected to the effect of machine beaters. At this point,
		various filler materials can be added such as chalks, clays, or
		chemicals such as titanium oxide. These additives will influence
		the opacity and other qualities of the final product. Sizings are
		also added at this point. Sizing affects the way the paper will
		react with various inks. Without any sizing at all, a paper will be
		too absorbent for most uses except as a desk blotter. A sizing such
		as starch makes the paper resistant to water-based ink (inks
		actually sit on top of a sheet of paper, rather than sinking in). A
		variety of sizings, generally rosins and gums, is available
		depending on the eventual use of the paper. Paper that will receive
		a printed design, such as gift wrapping, requires a particular
		formula of sizing that will make the paper accept the printing
		properly.</p>
	<h3>Pulp to Paper</h3>
	<p>In order to finally turn the pulp into paper, the pulp is fed or
		pumped into giant, automated machines. One common type is called
		the Fourdrinier machine, which was invented in England in 1807.
		Pulp is fed into the Fourdrinier machine on a moving belt of fine
		mesh screening. The pulp is squeezed through a series of rollers,
		while suction devices below the belt drain off water. If the paper
		is to receive a water-mark, a device called a dandy moves across
		the sheet of pulp and presses a design into it. The paper then
		moves onto the press section of the machine, where it is pressed
		between rollers of wool felt. The paper then passes over a series
		of steam-heated cylinders to remove the remaining water. A large
		machine may have from 40 to 70 drying cylinders.</p>
	<h3>Finishing</h3>
	<p>Finally, the dried paper is wound onto large reels, where it
		will be further processed depending on its ultimate use. Paper is
		smoothed and compacted further by passing through metal rollers
		called calendars. A particular finish, whether soft and dull or
		hard and shiny, can be imparted by the calendars. The paper may be
		further finished by passing through a vat of sizing material. It
		may also receive a coating, which is either brushed on or rolled
		on. Coating adds chemicals or pigments to the paper's surface,
		supplementing the sizings and fillers from earlier in the process.
		Fine clay is often used as a coating. The paper may next be
		supercalendered, that is, run through extremely smooth calendar
		rollers, for a final time. Then the paper is cut to the desired
		size.</p>
