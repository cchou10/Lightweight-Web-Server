<h2 class = "althead">Environment Concerns</h2>
<div class = "alternate">
	<p>The number of trees and other vegetation cut down in order to
		make paper is enormous. Paper companies insist that they plant as
		many new trees as they cut down. Environmentalists contend that the
		new growth trees, so much younger and smaller than what was removed,
		cannot replace the value of older trees. Efforts to recycle used
		paper (especially newspapers) have been effective in at least
		partially mitigating the need for destruction of woodlands, and
		recycled paper is now an important ingredient in many types of paper
		production. </p>
	<p>The chemicals used in paper manufacture, including dyes, inks,
		bleach, and sizing, can also be harmful to the environment when they
		are released into water supplies and nearby land after use. The
		industry has, sometimes with government prompting, cleared up a large
		amount of pollution, and federal requirements now demand
		pollutionfree paper production. The cost of such clean-up efforts is
		passed on to the consumer.</p>
